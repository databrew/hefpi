`hefpi` is a web application for the visual exploration of the World Bank's Health Equity and Financial Protection Indicators. It is currently under active development. 

## Installation

You can install hefpi from github by running the following:

``` r
devtools::install_github('databrew/hefpi')
```

## Development

To work on developing this package, you'll likely want to focus on the following files:

- `R/app_server.R`: The server-side code
- `R/app_ui.R`: The user interface
- `dev/run_dev.R`: The code you'll use to run the app locally after making changes

## Deploy

To deploy on a shiny server, simply place an `app.R` file in a folder as one normally would do, and populate that file with the following lines:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(hefpi)
run_app()
```

## Reproducing this package

In order to build this package and run the application correctly, one should:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/databrew/hefpi`.  
2. Populate the `data-raw/from_web` directory with the following two files (supplied directly from the WB): (a) `hefpi_full_database.dta` and (b) `Indicator_description.xlsx`. 
3. Populate the `data-raw/from_website` directory with the following three files (taken from the HEFPI website): (a) `HEFPICountry.csv`, (b) `HEFPIData.csv`, and (c) `HEFPISeries.csv`.
4. Run the script in the same directory to generate R-compatible data files: `Rscript raw_data.R`
5. Run `Rscript dev/run_dev.R`
